# Final GWUBootcamp Project : Loan Approval Classification

The goal of this project is to develop an AI-driven classification model to assess loan applicants’ risk levels. By leveraging machine learning, data engineering, and AI, we aim to 
determine whether an applicant is a low-risk or high-risk borrower. This classification will assist banks in making informed lending decisions, minimizing default rates, and optimizing profitability.

## Project Objectives

 1. Risk Classification: Develop a model that accurately predicts if a loan applicant is a low-risk or high-risk borrower.
 2. Data Utilization: Integrate data from various sources (customer profiles, financial history, credit scores, employment details, etc.).
 3. Data Cleaning & Engineering: Ensure high-quality, well-structured data by performing preprocessing techniques like missing value handling, normalization, and feature engineering.
 4. AI & ML Implementation: Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, neural networks) to identify the best-performing algorithm.
 5. Database Management: Store and retrieve customer data efficiently using SQL and NoSQL databases.
 6. Performance Optimization: Improve model accuracy through hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and ensemble methods.
 7. Deployment: Develop a streamlined pipeline for real-time loan risk assessment, integrating it with banking systems or a front-end dashboard.

## Problem Statement

Traditional loan approval processes often rely on manual assessments and rigid rules, leading to misclassifications that increase default risks or deny creditworthy applicants. 
This project aims to develop an AI-driven classification model using machine learning and data engineering to predict whether a borrower poses a low or high risk to the bank. 
By leveraging historical financial data and predictive analytics, the system will enhance decision-making, reduce defaults, and optimize profitability for financial institutions.

Key Features

*  1. AI-Powered Risk Assessment – Utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify loan applicants as low-risk or high-risk, improving accuracy and reducing default rates
*  2. Automated Data Processing – Integrates data cleaning, feature engineering, and real-time database management to ensure high-quality, up-to-date applicant information

## Milestones

*  Data Collection & Preparation: Gather and preprocess loan applicant data, ensuring it is cleaned, structured, and ready for analysis
*  Model Development & Evaluation: Train and optimize machine learning models for loan risk classification, refining performance based on evaluation metrics
*  Model Finalization & Reporting: Finalize the best-performing model, create comprehensive documentation, and present the results and insights to stakeholders

## Success Criteria

* The model should achieve an accuracy rate of at least 85% in classifying loan applicants into low-risk or high-risk categories, indicating reliable performance.

## Challenges and Risks

The main challenges and risks of this project include handling imbalanced data, where the number of low-risk applicants may vastly outnumber high-risk applicants, 
potentially skewing model predictions. There is also the risk of overfitting, where the model may perform well on training data but fail to generalize to unseen data. 
Data quality could be another challenge, as incomplete or inaccurate customer information may affect the model’s ability to make accurate predictions. Additionally, 
regulatory compliance must be carefully considered to ensure the model adheres to data privacy laws and fair lending practices.
